# 🧑‍💻 Technical Skills Rating System (1–10)

This repository provides a **universal, evidence-based system** to rate technical skills
(programming languages, libraries, tools, platforms) on a **1–10 scale**.

The goal: move beyond "I know X" to **provable, auditable skill levels**.

---

## 📊 Why This Exists
- Everyone claims "expert" — this system makes it measurable.
- Works across **programming languages** (Python, Java, SQL) and **tools** (Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Pandas, Spark).
- Balances **practical usage, depth, performance, and contribution**.

---

## 🔢 The 1–10 Scale (Summary)

- **1–3 → Novice**: Tutorial-level, basic tasks.
- **4–6 → Practitioner**: Independent work, medium complexity.
- **7–8 → Expert**: Designs solutions, optimizes, mentors.
- **9–10 → Authority**: Community contributor, innovator, recognized leader.
